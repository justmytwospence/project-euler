# project-euler

Learning Clojure with Project Euler. Code for the solution runner (core.clj) was taken from [guillaume-nargeot](https://github.com/guillaume-nargeot/project-euler-clojure/blob/master/src/project_euler/core.clj), but all other solutions are mine.

Run a particular problem number `n`:

```
lein run n
```
